## 🕹️ Hangman Game – React Edition
Welcome to Hangman, the classic word-guessing game – now rebuilt using React + Vite for a smooth, modern UI experience!
Test your vocabulary, challenge yourself, and have some fun! 🎯

### 🚀 Features
🔤 Guess the hidden word one letter at a time

⚠️ Limited number of wrong guesses before game over

🎨 Responsive and minimal UI built with React

🧠 Randomized word logic and reusable component structure

⚡️ Lightning-fast development with Vite

```
📁 Folder Structure
hangman-react/
├── index.html              # Entry HTML file
├── package.json            # Project dependencies and scripts
├── vite.config.js          # Vite configuration
├── src/
│   ├── App.jsx             # Root component
│   ├── App.css             # App-level styles
│   ├── main.jsx            # Entry point for React
│   ├── index.css           # Global styles
│   ├── components/         # All reusable components (e.g., Keyboard, WordDisplay, Header)
│   └── helpers/            # Utility functions (e.g., word generator, game logic)
```

### 🧠 How It Works
The app selects a random word from a predefined list.

The user guesses letters via the on-screen keyboard.

If a guessed letter is incorrect, the hangman drawing progresses.

The game ends when the user either completes the word or runs out of attempts.
